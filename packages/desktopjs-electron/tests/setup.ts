/**
 * Jest Setup File for desktopJS-electron
 * 
 * This file is executed after Jest is initialized but before tests are run.
 * It configures the testing environment with:
 * 1. Custom matchers for testing promises and rejections
 * 2. TypeScript type definitions for the custom matchers
 * 3. Global test utilities needed across multiple test files
 * 
 * This setup is consistent across all desktopJS packages to ensure
 * uniform testing behavior.
